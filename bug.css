The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error:  Specificity conflicts and unexpected cascading behavior. The intention is to style all paragraphs within the `.container` class, but due to conflicting specificity, the more general paragraph selector might override the more specific selector. 

```css
.container p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```
